#UserID Input Formatting

###New ID format
The following format is the new one that SMU uses. It contains
three tracks that we care about, as well as the card holder's name.

    %0000000000000000000000000?;00000000000000000=00000000000?+00000000=LAST=FIRST=STATUS?

###Old ID
The following format is the old one that SMU used. It only has two tracks and
begins with a semicolon.

    ;0000000000000000=000000000000?
